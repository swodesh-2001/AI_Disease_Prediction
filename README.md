Welcome to the Disease Prediction App, a desktop application built using the Tkinter framework in Python. This application utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease and breast cancer, as well as classify general diseases based on a set of input parameters.

Our application uses a trained machine learning model to make predictions and classifications based on user input. The model was trained on a large dataset of medical records, using various classification and regression techniques. The user interface is simple and intuitive, allowing users to input their data and receive results with ease.

We hope that our Disease Prediction App can help individuals take a proactive approach to their health and lead to earlier detection and prevention of diseases. We welcome feedback and contributions from the open-source community to improve the accuracy and usability of the app.
